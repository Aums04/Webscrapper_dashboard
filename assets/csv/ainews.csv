Though her startup, Thinking Machines Lab, has kept a low public profile, a new report from The Information offers early insight into what the company may be working on. According to the report, Murati’s company is focused on creating AI tools designed around a client’s key performance indicators (KPIs)—metrics used to track business goals. The startup reportedly plans to use reinforcement learning, a technique where AI systems learn by repeatedly attempting a task and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. This method helps models improve over time through trial and error. Murati’s Background and Funding Push Murati joined OpenAI in 2016 and rose to a senior leadership role, serving briefly as interim CEO during the company’s high-profile leadership shakeup in 2023, when Sam Altman was briefly ousted and then reinstated. She left OpenAI in September 2024 and has since been raising funds and recruiting talent for her new venture. Thinking Machines Lab has reportedly raised $2 billion at a $10 billion valuation, with much of that momentum driven by Murati’s reputation and network in the AI industry. Building Models Faster Using Open-Source AI Training advanced AI models from scratch can be time-consuming and expensive, so Murati is said to be pursuing a more modular approach. Rather than building full models from the ground up, the startup aims to “pluck” specific layers from existing open-source AI models and recombine them to suit specific tasks. Because open-source models don’t require an API to access, this strategy could allow the company to move quickly and operate more independently than larger competitors. To understand this, consider how a model like ChatGPT processes information. Input data moves through a stack of neural network “layers,” each handling a different aspect of language understanding and response generation. By selectively combining certain layers, Murati hopes to construct powerful AI models tailored to business use cases—faster and more efficiently than traditional methods. It remains unclear which tasks Thinking Machines Lab’s models will target, or what the cost of developing a custom solution will be. A Consumer Product May Also Be in the Works Although much of the focus appears to be on enterprise AI tools, The Information also reports that Thinking Machines Lab is developing a consumer-facing product, potentially a rival to ChatGPT. Details about its features or timeline remain unclear. Ties—and Distance—from Meta Murati has reportedly been among several AI founders in recent talks with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who is investing heavily in AI through talent acquisition and startup partnerships. However, the report notes that discussions between Murati and Zuckerberg “didn’t get far.” Looking Ahead While Thinking Machines Lab remains largely under wraps, Murati’s strategy points to a future where AI tools are not one-size-fits-all, but custom-built to meet the exact goals of each business. If her team can successfully combine open-source components into specialized, reinforcement-trained models, it could offer a faster, leaner path to enterprise AI adoption—and challenge the dominance of today’s biggest model providers. Murati’s next steps may help define whether modular AI can deliver not just speed, but real competitive edge.

Verizon Taps Google’s Gemini AI to Improve Customer Service,,"https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=800,height=421,fit=scale-down,onerror=redirect/uploads/asset/file/5a4480e1-0d80-4c74-915a-d494acd0faee/Verizon_Taps_Google_s_Gemini_AI_to_Improve_Customer_Service.png",2025-06-25T18:26:16.284Z,https://www.ainews.com/,False,https://www.ainews.com/p/verizon-taps-google-s-gemini-ai-to-improve-customer-service,"Image Source: ChatGPT-4o Verizon Taps Google’s Gemini AI to Improve Customer Service Verizon is revamping its customer service system with a new AI-powered assistant built on Google’s Gemini technology, aiming to make support faster and more efficient. The updated My Verizon app, launched earlier this week, features the “Verizon Assistant,” a chatbot designed to handle common customer needs such as managing device upgrades, adding new lines, addressing billing questions, and identifying savings opportunities. The assistant is part of a broader push by Verizon to automate tasks typically handled by human service representatives. According to the company, this shift will provide users with quicker, more flexible interactions. But human help isn’t going away—customers can still request to speak with a live agent, and the chatbot will automatically escalate conversations it can’t resolve on its own. Dory Butler, Verizon’s senior vice president of customer experience, told The Verge that the company worked closely with Google to tailor the assistant to Verizon’s specific services and customer needs. By building smaller, more focused language models, Verizon aims to limit errors—known as “hallucinations” in AI systems—and has so far achieved “north of 90 percent accuracy with very minor mistakes being made,” Butler said. Introducing AI-Backed “Customer Champions” In addition to the AI chatbot, Verizon is deploying what it calls a “Customer Champion” program. These representatives—still human, according to Verizon’s vague announcement—will use Google’s Gemini and Cloud AI tools to tackle more complex service issues. The company says these champions will manage the case end-to-end, providing updates through the app, text messages, or phone calls. The aim is for customers to resolve their issue in a single interaction with Verizon. To further improve accessibility, Verizon is expanding live support hours and launching 24/7 live chat, a move the company says better accommodates a range of customer schedules and preferences. What This Means Verizon’s move signals a growing reliance on AI to reshape how large companies interact with customers. By blending real-time automation with human backup, the company hopes to reduce friction in support experiences without losing the option for personal assistance. If successful, this hybrid model could become a standard across the telecom industry and beyond—balancing speed, accuracy, and human empathy in a single support channel.

In an interview with Reuters, the unnamed State Department official alleged that DeepSeek: Shares user information with China’s surveillance infrastructure, Provides direct support to Chinese military operations, Has used shell companies in Southeast Asia to obtain restricted U.S.-made AI chips. The official also claimed that DeepSeek has gained access to “large volumes” of high-performance Nvidia H100 chips, despite U.S. export controls banning their sale to China. The company, based in Hangzhou, did not respond to questions from Reuters. Deep Ties to China’s Defense Sector The U.S. government’s assessment, which had not been publicly reported until now, suggests that DeepSeek plays a more active role in Chinese state activities than previously known. According to the official, procurement records show DeepSeek mentioned over 150 times in relation to China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and other defense-linked entities. The company is said to have provided services to PLA-affiliated research institutions. Reuters could not independently verify the procurement data. The U.S. has long restricted American companies from working with Chinese firms linked to the military-industrial complex. But DeepSeek has not yet been placed on any U.S. trade blacklists, and officials have not alleged that Nvidia had any knowledge of DeepSeek's work with the Chinese military. One of the most direct concerns involves user data. While Chinese law requires companies to hand over data upon government request, the U.S. official alleged that DeepSeek has gone further — “willingly provided and will likely continue to provide support to China’s military and intelligence operations.” ""This effort goes above and beyond open-source access to DeepSeek's AI models,"" the official said. U.S. lawmakers have previously warned that DeepSeek transmits information from American users through backend systems linked to China Mobile, a state-owned telecommunications company. These claims are based in part on the company’s own privacy disclosures and raise serious privacy concerns for the platform’s global user base. DeepSeek’s tools remain widely available through major U.S. cloud providers including Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. The company claims tens of millions of daily users. Allegations of Export Evasion and Shell Firms According to the U.S. official, DeepSeek sought to bypass export restrictions on advanced U.S. chips by using shell companies in Southeast Asia. The company is also believed to have pursued access to regional data centers equipped with restricted chips — allowing remote use of U.S. hardware from outside China. The official declined to say whether these efforts succeeded or name the companies involved. Nvidia, which manufactures the H100 chips in question, said it had no knowledge of such use and emphasized that with current controls in place, it is “effectively out of the China data center market.” Nvidia added that DeepSeek’s known usage was limited to lawfully acquired H800 chips, a less powerful variant. In a separate case, three men in Singapore were charged with fraud in February in connection with shipments of Nvidia chips allegedly tied to DeepSeek. Model Claims Under Scrutiny DeepSeek gained global attention in January when it claimed its models — DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 — rivaled the most advanced offerings from U.S. leaders like OpenAI and Meta, but at far lower cost. The company said it spent only $5.58 million on training, a claim met with skepticism from AI experts. Some reports suggested DeepSeek possessed up to 50,000 Nvidia H100 chips. However, sources told Reuters the real number is much lower and that U.S. officials were investigating whether DeepSeek had access to restricted hardware. These reports have not been independently verified. Despite the concerns, no formal penalties or sanctions have been announced. “Our review indicates that DeepSeek used lawfully acquired H800 products, not H100. We do not support parties that have violated U.S. export controls or are on the U.S. entity lists,” Nvidia said. The Chinese government has not responded to the allegations. Malaysia, meanwhile, confirmed it is investigating whether a Chinese company operating locally is using servers with Nvidia chips to train large language models, possibly violating domestic laws. Cloud Hosting Doesn’t Always Mean Privacy While DeepSeek’s AI models are open source and can be run fully offline, many users access them through cloud-hosted interfaces on platforms like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud. These services give the impression of being secure and localized — but in many cases, DeepSeek still controls what happens behind the scenes. This is where the risk begins. When DeepSeek deploys its models on cloud infrastructure, it typically manages the software environment. That means the company—not the cloud provider—sets up the system, configures the backend, and can install analytics or telemetry tools that collect data on user behavior. Even if the servers themselves are physically located in the U.S., DeepSeek’s software can be designed to transmit that data elsewhere. U.S. lawmakers say DeepSeek’s own privacy disclosures acknowledge that user data may be routed through backend systems tied to China Mobile, a state-owned telecom provider. If accurate, that means prompts, usage patterns, or other sensitive information could be transmitted directly into Chinese networks—without the user’s knowledge. Most cloud providers do not actively inspect every application running on their infrastructure. Unless a customer is legally blacklisted or flagged for abuse, companies like DeepSeek can operate with broad control over their deployment. The cloud platforms act as hosts, not gatekeepers. This setup reveals a serious blind spot: even when models appear to be running “locally” in the U.S., the infrastructure is still controlled by the company that built them. And if that company is aligned with a foreign government, the data pipeline may already be open. Right now, DeepSeek is not on any U.S. trade blacklist, and it hasn’t been formally sanctioned or banned from using American cloud infrastructure. That’s because existing laws focus on hardware exports and direct commercial ties — not backend software operations or indirect data flows. And while U.S. officials allege that DeepSeek supports China’s military and intelligence efforts, those claims haven’t yet triggered legal action. The deeper concern is this: the U.S. may be facing a new kind of digital invasion — one that uses legal access, not force, to gain a strategic foothold inside American systems. In this landscape, the old definitions of compliance and control may no longer be enough. What This Means The DeepSeek case exposes a growing gap between technical capability and legal oversight. U.S. agencies may control the sale of advanced AI chips, but they have far less control over where — and how — those models are deployed once they’re in use. Even as concerns about national security and foreign surveillance mount, DeepSeek remains unsanctioned and legally active in U.S. commercial ecosystems. That reflects a deeper vulnerability: there are few existing tools to govern backend software access, cross-border data movement, or platform-level influence in AI systems. If U.S. authorities confirm that DeepSeek aided Chinese military or intelligence operations using American infrastructure, this case could become a turning point — one that redefines how AI is regulated, and which thresholds trigger enforcement. For now, the story remains a warning: powerful technologies, even when legally sourced, can still be used in ways that test the limits of trust, transparency, and accountability. How U.S. agencies respond — and whether they impose penalties or blacklist DeepSeek — could shape future controls not just on chip access, but on the global reach of state-aligned AI. But the broader dilemma remains: in a world where talent, data, and computation cross borders fluidly, can any country truly fence in the tools of artificial intelligence? The deeper challenge may not be what’s built — but who controls what comes next.

Judge Rules Anthropic’s Use of Purchased Books to Train AI Is Fair Use,,"https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=800,height=421,fit=scale-down,onerror=redirect/uploads/asset/file/5e15ba11-67b3-4855-9df2-e885fb62eb86/Judge_Rules_Anthropic_s_Use_of_Purchased_Books_to_Train_AI_Is_Fair_Use.png",2025-06-25T16:30:59.525Z,https://www.ainews.com/,False,https://www.ainews.com/p/judge-rules-anthropic-s-use-of-purchased-books-to-train-ai-is-fair-use,"Image Source: ChatGPT-4o Judge Rules Anthropic’s Use of Purchased Books to Train AI Is Fair Use A federal judge has ruled that Anthropic did not violate copyright law by using legally purchased books to train its artificial intelligence models, marking a significant, if narrow, legal victory for the AI startup. However, the company still faces a separate trial over allegations that it relied on pirated books in the same training process. The decision, issued by Judge William Alsup of the Northern District of California, concluded that scanning and digitizing physical books bought by Anthropic — even after physically disassembling them — qualifies as fair use. The court also found that using those scanned books to train large language models (LLMs) was “sufficiently transformative” to fall under the same protection. This is the first time a U.S. court has clearly backed the AI industry’s argument that model training on legally obtained material can be fair use. Still, the ruling is limited to a specific scenario: books Anthropic physically purchased and digitized for training purposes. Legal Claims Split in Two The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by authors Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber, and Kirk Wallace Johnson, who accused Anthropic of training its Claude family of AI models on pirated versions of their books. While Judge Alsup sided with Anthropic on the purchased books, he declined to dismiss claims related to pirated content. According to the court, Anthropic built a centralized digital library containing both purchased and pirated books. The company’s defense — that some of these materials may not have been directly used for training — didn’t convince the judge that such copying could be fair use. “This order doubts that any accused infringer could ever meet its burden of explaining why downloading source copies from pirate sites that it could have purchased or otherwise accessed lawfully was itself reasonably necessary to any subsequent fair use,” Alsup wrote, emphasizing that point in his ruling. Authors’ Rights vs. AI’s Progress Judge Alsup drew a sharp line between protecting authors from unfair exploitation and enabling transformative innovation. In his opinion, he compared Anthropic’s use of books for AI training to educators teaching children to write — a process that inherently involves learning from existing work. “Authors’ complaint is no different than it would be if they complained that training schoolchildren to write well would result in an explosion of competing works,” he wrote, adding that the Copyright Act is meant “to advance original works of authorship, not to protect authors against competition.” Anthropic welcomed the ruling, emphasizing its models were designed to create novel outputs, not to replicate or replace the original books. “We are pleased that the Court recognized that using works to train LLMs was transformative — spectacularly so,” said Anthropic spokesperson Jennifer Martinez. She added that the company’s use of content was consistent with copyright law’s aim to “enable creativity and foster scientific progress.” Looking Ahead While the fair use ruling offers some legal clarity for AI developers relying on purchased materials, the unresolved claims around pirated books pose a serious challenge. A separate trial will determine whether Anthropic’s use of unauthorized copies was unlawful and what damages, if any, the company may owe. This case may shape future legal standards for how AI models can be trained — and where the line lies between innovation and infringement. Weighing the Trade-Offs Even as courts begin to define the legal boundaries for AI training, the rulings may come too late to meaningfully rebalance the landscape. Companies like Anthropic already trained models on massive datasets, including potentially pirated materials. A fair use decision on legally purchased books sets precedent, but it doesn’t reverse any benefits gained from earlier, more controversial practices. If courts ultimately impose fines or damages for unauthorized use, it raises a broader question: are those penalties enough to deter future violations — or simply the cost of doing business? The line between fair innovation and unfair advantage may be getting clearer, but for many authors and rights holders, the harm may already be done. But there’s also a broader view. To achieve the remarkable capabilities we now expect from AI — from instant translation to life-saving medical insights — this messy phase may have been unavoidable. The outputs rely on enormous volumes of data, much of it human-made. While rights holders deserve compensation, the long-term public benefits of powerful AI systems may, in some eyes, justify how we got here. The question isn’t just what’s legal — it’s what kind of trade-offs we’re willing to live with.

Reddit Weighs Adopting Sam Altman’s Iris-Scanning Orb for User Verification,,"https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=800,height=421,fit=scale-down,onerror=redirect/uploads/asset/file/e516898d-f2c1-46c6-9920-865f3b91be02/Reddit_Weighs_Adopting_Sam_Altman_s_Iris-Scanning_Orb_for_User_Verification.png",2025-06-24T19:45:16.914Z,https://www.ainews.com/,False,https://www.ainews.com/p/reddit-weighs-adopting-sam-altman-s-iris-scanning-orb-for-user-verification,"Image Source: ChatGPT-4o Reddit Weighs Adopting Sam Altman’s Iris-Scanning Orb for User Verification Reddit is considering a bold new approach to verifying its users: the World ID system, which uses an iris-scanning “Orb” created by Tools for Humanity—a company co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. The idea is to let users prove they’re real, unique, human individuals without having to reveal their actual identities. Why the Push Now? The move comes as generative AI continues to flood social platforms with fake content, bots, and misinformation. Platforms like Reddit are under increasing pressure—from governments and users alike—to prove that their users are real people, and in some cases, of legal age. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman has suggested that “age and human checks” could soon become standard for the site’s more than 1 billion users. World ID could offer a third-party verification option that keeps identity in the user’s hands—with verification remaining anonymized and fully optional. How It Works World ID uses a device called the Orb to scan a person’s iris in person, generating a secure digital identity known as a World ID. This identity is not tied to a user’s name, face, or other personal details. The system does not store raw biometric data or images. Instead, it creates a unique encrypted code—sometimes called an “iris hash”—which is fragmented across secure servers. World ID uses advanced cryptographic techniques like zero-knowledge proofs and multiparty computation to ensure privacy. The final ID is stored locally on the user’s device, not in a centralized database or public blockchain. This allows users to verify that they are real, unique, human individuals without revealing their personal identity—supporting anonymous participation online while limiting duplicate accounts or fake personas. A Divided Reaction On Reddit, news of the potential integration has drawn strong reactions. Many users say they would leave the platform if biometric verification is introduced, even if it’s optional. Others worry that such a move—even in the name of fighting bots and misinformation—would erode the culture of anonymity that has defined Reddit for decades. Some privacy-focused communities have been especially vocal, arguing that no system based on biometric data can ever be truly voluntary when it intersects with core features like visibility, trust, or moderation tools. What This Means Reddit’s consideration of World ID highlights a growing dilemma for internet platforms: how to balance safety, accountability, and privacy in an AI-saturated digital world. The idea of verifying users without de-anonymizing them is compelling—but the means of doing so matter. Iris scans, no matter how securely stored, carry deep symbolic and practical risks. Critics warn of a future where biometric verification becomes normalized—even expected—for basic access to digital life. That raises the stakes not just for Reddit, but for the internet’s future as a space where people can speak freely without being tracked or tagged. Even with World’s privacy safeguards—including zero-knowledge proofs and local data storage—any system involving biometric verification invites scrutiny, regulatory interest, and debate over long-term risk. Critics warn of “golden biometric databases” that, if breached or misused, could be irreversible. As AI agents become more capable—making purchases, booking travel, even communicating on behalf of users—the line between human and machine will only get blurrier. Systems like World ID may offer a way to distinguish real people from automated agents, but in doing so, they shift the burden of proof onto users: to verify not just who they are, but that they’re not AI. As Reddit balances these possibilities, its decision could set a precedent for how large communities manage trust—and tension—between technology, identity, and human connection.

Available today in alpha, 11ai serves as a live demonstration of ElevenLabs’ Conversational AI platform—showcasing how voice-first interaction, paired with structured integrations, can power real-world productivity. Unlike traditional voice assistants that are limited to answering questions, 11ai is designed to understand context and take sequential actions across common workplace tools. The assistant connects directly to applications like Slack, Notion, and Linear through a standardized integration layer called the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Voice-First, Action-Oriented Workflows 11ai is built to handle not just conversation, but execution. It connects to the services professionals already use—task boards, communication platforms, research tools—and aims to automate common actions by voice alone. Example workflows include: Morning planning: “Plan my day and add my priority tasks to Linear.” Customer research: “Use Perplexity to research our prospect meeting today and summarize their recent funding.” Project management: “Search our Linear issues for the API bug and create a new ticket for the follow-up work.” Team updates: “Catch me up on yesterday’s Slack messages in the engineering channel.” In each case, 11ai is designed to understand the user’s intent, gather relevant information, and take action in the appropriate tool—closing the loop between conversation and execution. What Is MCP? The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized framework that allows AI agents to securely integrate with external APIs. ElevenLabs’ Conversational AI platform now supports MCP natively, enabling 11ai to connect to widely used services like Salesforce, HubSpot, Gmail, Zapier, and others. Out-of-the-box integrations currently include: Perplexity for real-time web-powered research Linear for issue tracking & project management Slack for messaging and team updates Notion for knowledge and task management More integrations are being released each week as the platform continues to expand. Developers can also connect custom MCP servers, allowing organizations to integrate 11ai with internal or specialized tools. Each connection is permission-controlled, ensuring the assistant only performs actions the user has explicitly authorized. Powered by ElevenLabs Conversational AI 11ai also serves as a showcase for the broader capabilities of ElevenLabs’ voice technology stack. The platform offers: Ultra-low latency for real-time responsiveness Multimodal support, blending voice and text Integrated RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) for external knowledge access and context-aware responses Automatic language detection for multilingual conversations Enterprise-grade security, including HIPAA compliance Users can choose from over 5,000 voices or generate a custom clone to personalize the experience. Combined, these features allow 11ai to function more like a virtual teammate than a generic voice bot. Privacy and Data Use According to ElevenLabs, all conversations with 11ai are encrypted and access is tightly controlled under strict data protection policies. The company says user interactions are only used to improve the service, not for unrelated data collection or external sharing. Free Access in Alpha 11ai is now available in an experimental alpha phase. ElevenLabs is offering free access to gather user feedback and refine the platform. To try it out: Sign up at 11.ai and complete the setup Select your voice or create a custom one Connect tools like Google Calendar, Slack, Perplexity, or your own MCP endpoints Try your first workflow, such as planning your day or summarizing a research topic The company is especially interested in learning which integrations are most valuable, what additional MCP endpoints users want, how the conversational experience compares to traditional interfaces, and what new capabilities would make 11ai essential for your daily routine. What This Means With 11ai, ElevenLabs is joining a growing field of AI products designed to move beyond chat—and into action. While many AI systems focus on language generation, 11ai is built around structured interaction: using voice to trigger real-world updates, task management, and workflow support. It’s still early—the product is labeled as a proof of concept—but the architecture suggests a longer-term vision: one where voice assistants don’t just respond, but participate meaningfully in everyday work. By open-sourcing access through MCP and offering custom server support, ElevenLabs is positioning 11ai not just as a consumer tool, but as a developer platform for the next wave of productivity-focused AI. Whether or not 11ai becomes a standalone product, it offers a compelling glimpse of where AI assistants may be heading next: from passive listeners to active collaborators.

Court Filings Reveal OpenAI and io Explored AI Hardware Beyond Earbuds,,"https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=800,height=421,fit=scale-down,onerror=redirect/uploads/asset/file/29953860-41a7-43b8-aa0f-24ea90c5258a/Court_Filings_Reveal_OpenAI_and_io_Explored_AI_Hardware_Beyond_Earbuds.png",2025-06-24T18:06:02.007Z,https://www.ainews.com/,False,https://www.ainews.com/p/court-filings-reveal-openai-and-io-explored-ai-hardware-beyond-earbuds,"Image Source: ChatGPT-4o Court Filings Reveal OpenAI and io Explored AI Hardware Beyond Earbuds New court filings have revealed early efforts by OpenAI and Jony Ive’s hardware startup, io, to develop an AI-powered consumer device—one that may not resemble the in-ear wearable many observers expected. The update follows yesterday’s news that OpenAI removed all promotional materials related to its $6.5 billion acquisition of io, complying with a court order tied to a trademark lawsuit filed by iyO, a Google-backed startup developing custom-molded earpieces. The documents, submitted as part of the case, offer a rare look at the companies’ research and early-stage plans. OpenAI denies the allegations and is contesting the case. Device May Not Be a Headphone or Wearable Legal filings from OpenAI and io show that the companies spent the past year researching in-ear hardware, purchasing more than 30 sets of headphones to study the market. Internal emails also reveal that executives from both companies met with iyO to test its custom earpiece technology. Despite that interest, the product now in development appears to be something else entirely. Tang Tan, io’s chief hardware officer and a longtime Apple executive, stated in a court declaration that the prototype referenced in the company’s launch video “is not an in-ear device, nor a wearable device.” He noted the design remains unfinished and won’t be available for sale or promotion for at least another year. The physical design remains largely unknown. In the company’s launch video, Sam Altman said they were developing a “family” of AI devices with different capabilities, while Jony Ive described the first prototype as something that “completely captured” his imagination. Altman had previously described the device as a “third device,” one meant to complement smartphones and laptops. In an internal meeting reported by The Wall Street Journal, Altman told OpenAI staff the hardware would be pocket-sized or sit on a desk and would be fully aware of a user’s surroundings. “Our intent with this collaboration was, and is, to create products that go beyond traditional products and interfaces,” Altman said in a June 12 court filing. OpenAI’s lawyers added that the company has evaluated multiple device formats, including desktop-based, mobile, wireless, wired, wearable, and portable designs. Behind the Meeting With Iyo According to case documents, OpenAI and io showed early interest in iyO’s technology. In May, OpenAI VP of Product Peter Welinder and io’s Tang Tan met with iyO CEO Jason Rugolo at io’s Jackson Square office in San Francisco. During the meeting, they tested iyO’s in-ear device, but according to follow-up emails, the demonstration failed to meet expectations. Tan said he agreed to the meeting as a favor to a former mentor—Apple veteran Steve Zadesky—and claimed he took precautions to avoid exposure to proprietary information, including asking his lawyers to review materials before he did. He also said that after evaluating iyO’s offering, he declined multiple proposals from Rugolo, including a $200 million acquisition offer and a potential developer-kit partnership. Additional emails suggest io staff considered insights from iyO’s ecosystem. Marwan Rammah, a former Apple engineer now at io, suggested buying a 3D ear scan database from iyO’s partner, The Ear Project, to better understand ergonomic design. It remains unclear if any transaction occurred. Despite the interactions, io co-founder and Chief Product Officer Evans Hankey stated in a declaration that the company is not working on a custom-molded earpiece. What This Means The court filings offer the clearest window yet into OpenAI and io’s early-stage hardware plans—and reveal just how uncertain and unfinalized those plans still are. What began as speculation about AI-powered earbuds now appears to be something different altogether. And while the device remains more than a year from market, the legal dispute has already forced OpenAI to remove public-facing content and defend its intent in court. That matters. For a company as secretive and brand-sensitive as OpenAI, being compelled to explain its product direction under oath is unusual—and telling. The filings suggest the company is still actively exploring different form factors, and that its prototype isn’t as far along as public hype may have suggested. Whether this is strategic secrecy or necessary backtracking isn’t yet clear, but the company’s tone in the filings is notably cautious. More broadly, this legal conflict underscores how competitive and legally risky the AI hardware race has become. Companies like OpenAI, Apple, Meta, and Google are not only competing to define the next interface—but are also moving into one another’s hardware turf. That overlap is likely to trigger more intellectual property disputes as startups and tech giants alike fight for design and market share. For now, the filings show that OpenAI’s vision for a mass-market AI device is still evolving. And though the legal fight may slow down public rollout, it’s also offering the public an unusual look at how one of the most influential AI firms is thinking about the future of human-computer interaction. This glimpse into OpenAI’s hardware strategy suggests its first AI device won’t be worn—it will be something altogether new.

Elon Musk Plans to Rewrite Human History Using Grok AI,,"https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=800,height=421,fit=scale-down,onerror=redirect/uploads/asset/file/09168325-9e9f-418b-b9c8-870e4fd63dd3/Elon_Musk_Plans_to_Rewrite_Human_History_Using_Grok_AI.png",2025-06-24T17:10:07.697Z,https://www.ainews.com/,False,https://www.ainews.com/p/elon-musk-plans-to-rewrite-human-history-using-grok-ai,"Image Source: ChatGPT-4o Elon Musk Plans to Rewrite Human History Using Grok AI Elon Musk says his AI company, xAI, plans to retrain its Grok chatbot by rewriting the entire foundation of its knowledge base—including the full record of human history. Musk claims that existing AI models are built on biased or inaccurate information, and says Grok will instead be trained on a corrected version of history shaped by user-submitted facts. A Plan to ""Correct"" the Record In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Musk announced plans to retrain Grok on a “cleaned” dataset by first using the upcoming Grok 3.5 model to “rewrite the entire corpus of human knowledge, adding missing information and deleting errors.” He described existing training data used in other AI models as full of “garbage” and “uncorrected data.” According to Musk, Grok 3.5 will be equipped with “advanced reasoning” and tasked with purging inaccuracies from the internet’s record. Once revised, the new knowledge base will be used to retrain the model from scratch. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI but later distanced himself from the company, has frequently criticized mainstream AI systems like ChatGPT for what he calls political bias. He has positioned Grok as an “anti-woke” alternative—an approach that aligns with his broader push against political correctness. Since taking over Twitter in 2022, Musk has relaxed content moderation on the platform, allowing a wave of conspiracy theories, extremist rhetoric, and false claims to circulate—some of which he has echoed or amplified. In response to criticism, he launched a “Community Notes” feature, allowing users to append context to misleading posts. Critics Warn of Dangerous Precedent His latest move, however, has triggered warnings from AI researchers and philosophers alike. “Straight out of 1984,” wrote Gary Marcus, an AI entrepreneur and professor emeritus of neural science at NYU, on X. “You couldn’t get Grok to align with your own personal beliefs so you are going to rewrite history to make it conform to your views.” Image Source: Musk & Marcus X Posts Philosophy of science professor Bernardino Sassoli de’ Bianchi of the University of Milan called the proposal “dangerous,” warning that altering training data to reflect ideological preferences amounts to “narrative control.” He added: “Rewriting training data to match ideology is wrong on every conceivable level.” As part of Grok’s retraining process, Musk has invited X users to contribute what he called “divisive facts”—defined as politically incorrect yet “factually true.” The open call has already drawn a flood of controversial claims, many of which have been widely discredited. Among the responses: Holocaust distortion, anti-vaccine misinformation, pseudoscientific racism, and climate change denial. What This Means Elon Musk’s plan to rewrite Grok’s training data represents more than a technical pivot—it’s a direct challenge to how truth is defined, preserved, and propagated in the digital age. AI systems already influence what billions of people see, learn, and believe. When the data that trains these systems is rewritten to fit the worldview of a single individual or community, the line between information and ideology begins to blur. This isn’t just about one model. Musk is inviting users to reshape Grok’s foundation with what he calls “politically incorrect but factually true” claims—many of which include discredited conspiracy theories, misleading scientific assertions, and distorted versions of history. If those submissions are used to retrain Grok, the result could be an AI system that presents misinformation as fact under the guise of correction. The danger isn’t hypothetical. AI-generated content is increasingly used in education, media, and policymaking. A model trained on distorted data doesn’t just risk confusion—it risks normalizing falsehoods at scale. At its core, this move reframes AI not as a tool for understanding the world, but as a mechanism for rewriting it. And once a version of history is rewritten into an AI system, undoing that change becomes exponentially harder. If powerful individuals can redefine historical “facts” through algorithmic design, the implications extend far beyond one chatbot. They reach into the heart of public trust, democratic discourse, and the integrity of information itself.

The move follows a legal challenge over the name—but the underlying partnership remains intact. The content was taken down shortly after OpenAI announced its $6.5 billion acquisition and plans to develop dedicated AI hardware. The original blog post and a nine-minute promotional video featuring both Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman are no longer available online. Image Source: OpenAI Newsroom X Post Trademark Dispute Behind the Removal According to a statement shared with The Verge, OpenAI confirmed that the removal was prompted by a trademark lawsuit from Iyo, a hearing device company that spun out of Google’s experimental lab, formerly known as X (or ""moonshot factory""). An OpenAI spokesperson, Kayla Wood, stated: ""This page is temporarily down due to a court order following a trademark complaint from iyO about our use of the name ‘io.’ We don’t agree with the complaint and are reviewing our options."" Despite the branding conflict, OpenAI maintains that the partnership with Jony Ive’s team is still active and progressing. Background on the Partnership In the original joint announcement—now removed—the companies said: ""The io team, focused on developing products that inspire, empower and enable, will now merge with OpenAI to work more intimately with the research, engineering and product teams in San Francisco."" The collaboration was framed as a major step in building consumer-facing AI hardware, combining OpenAI’s software capabilities with Ive’s design expertise. It was pitched as a new kind of device—meant to be as indispensable as a laptop or smartphone. What This Means The removal of the “io” branding underscores how even high-profile tech collaborations can be tripped up by legal conflicts—especially around naming and trademarks. It’s a reminder that brand identity, while often secondary to product vision, can still derail public momentum and visibility. Still, the underlying goal remains unchanged: to bring AI closer to users through purpose-built hardware. While the project's name may evolve, the stakes haven’t. The partnership between Jony Ive and OpenAI represents one of the most closely watched efforts to fuse cutting-edge AI with industrial design—a combination that could shape how consumers experience artificial intelligence in daily life.

Apple in Early Talks to Acquire Perplexity AI for Reported $14 Billion,,"https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=800,height=421,fit=scale-down,onerror=redirect/uploads/asset/file/fb03aee9-0e15-40b8-992e-b0b113bb4e9e/Apple_in_Early_Talks_to_Acquire_Perplexity_AI_for_Reported__14_Billion.png",2025-06-23T19:03:21.169Z,https://www.ainews.com/,False,https://www.ainews.com/p/apple-in-early-talks-to-acquire-perplexity-ai-for-reported-14-billion,"Image Source: ChatGPT-4o Apple in Early Talks to Acquire Perplexity AI for Reported $14 Billion Apple is reportedly in the early stages of exploring an acquisition of Perplexity AI, a fast-growing artificial intelligence startup valued at around $14 billion. According to Bloomberg, Apple executives have discussed the possibility internally, though no formal offer has been made and Perplexity’s leadership has not been approached. The talks, first surfaced in Bloomberg and confirmed by Reuters and Apple Insider, suggest Apple is evaluating Perplexity as a strategic asset to expand its AI-powered search capabilities—potentially reducing reliance on Google and enhancing long-term projects like Siri and Safari. In a statement to Reuters, Perplexity said, “We have no knowledge of any current or future M&A discussions involving Perplexity.” Apple has declined to comment. Strategic Motivations Behind Apple’s Interest Sources say the internal discussions have involved Adrian Perica, Apple’s head of mergers and acquisitions, and Eddy Cue, Apple’s services chief. While still early, the prospect of acquiring Perplexity reflects Apple’s broader shift toward building its own AI search infrastructure. Currently, Apple receives an estimated $20 billion annually from Google to keep Google as the default search engine across Apple devices—a relationship now under intense scrutiny in a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust case. Acquiring Perplexity could position Apple to offer its own integrated search solution. In testimony during the trial, Cue acknowledged conversations with Perplexity: “We’ve been pretty impressed with what Perplexity has done, so we’ve started some discussions with them about what they’re doing,” he said. Although acquisition is reportedly the main focus, a strategic partnership—such as embedding Perplexity into Safari or future Siri upgrades—is also being considered, according to Apple Insider. Some observers suggest that Apple may be exploring deals with multiple AI providers—not unlike how it approaches hardware suppliers. Partnering with several AI providers could give users a wider range of tools, while helping Apple avoid overreliance on any one company—and potentially keeping costs more manageable. Perplexity’s Growing Appeal Perplexity AI has emerged as a leading alternative to traditional search engines, especially among younger users. Its interface delivers real-time, citation-backed answers in a conversational format, similar to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. The startup is backed by high-profile investors, including Nvidia, and recently closed a funding round at a $14 billion valuation. Bloomberg also reported that Meta attempted to acquire Perplexity earlier this year, underscoring the competitive interest in the startup’s technology and team. If Apple were to proceed with a deal at that valuation, it would mark the largest acquisition in the company’s history—far exceeding the $3 billion it paid for Beats in 2014. What This Means Apple’s interest in Perplexity signals a serious move toward reshaping how users search for information across its ecosystem. Rather than continuing to rely on external providers like Google, Apple appears to be weighing whether to bring cutting-edge AI search in-house. The potential $14 billion deal would not only mark a historic acquisition, but also reflect Apple’s intent to control more of the AI experience—especially as it prepares to overhaul Siri and expand its personalized “Apple Intelligence” strategy. Whether or not the deal goes through, the interest itself points to Apple’s evolving role in the AI race—and raises the stakes for the future of AI-powered search.

Perplexity AI Launches 8-Second Video Generator on X,,"https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=800,height=421,fit=scale-down,onerror=redirect/uploads/asset/file/d688dd0a-4832-4c52-8fbe-21dfee5aef33/Perplexity_AI_Launches_8-Second_Video_Generator_on_X.png",2025-06-23T18:29:45.507Z,https://www.ainews.com/,False,https://www.ainews.com/p/perplexity-ai-launches-8-second-video-generator-on-x,"Image Source: ChatGPT-4o Perplexity AI Launches 8-Second Video Generator on X Perplexity AI has introduced a new feature that lets users generate short, AI-created videos simply by tagging its @AskPerplexity bot on X (formerly Twitter). The update, announced on June 19, allows anyone to post a tweet with a brief prompt and receive an 8-second video complete with visuals, sound, and dialogue. The process is simple: tweet your idea, tag @AskPerplexity, and wait for the automated response. There's no app to download, no login required, and no technical experience necessary. Currently, this feature is only available on X and cannot be accessed through Perplexity’s main website, mobile app, or WhatsApp integration. Video generation does not yet extend to other platforms where Perplexity is available. Image Source: Ask Perplexity X Post Viral Launch and User Reactions The feature quickly gained traction, with social media users posting an array of lighthearted and creative prompts. Videos ranged from animated samosa parties to imagined conversations between celebrities and world leaders. The format’s blend of audio, visuals, and speech gave users a new, entertaining way to experiment with generative AI. To manage expectations, Perplexity noted that strong content filters are in place to prevent misuse. The Ask Perplexity account also acknowledged the surge in requests with a humorous tweet about the high volume of activity. As interest spiked, users experienced slower response times—an issue Perplexity addressed publicly, attributing it to heavy traffic. Building on Recent Expansions This update follows a string of recent moves by the company aimed at making AI tools more widely accessible. In April 2025, Perplexity launched on WhatsApp, offering users the ability to chat, create images, and do research—all from within the messaging platform. The new video feature builds on that momentum by bringing generative capabilities to a social platform many people already use, even if only through a single access point. A Simple, Social Approach to AI Creativity What makes this feature stand out is its ease of use. Unlike many AI video tools that require accounts, software, or advanced skills, this one lives directly on X and works through a tweet. That simplicity has helped drive engagement and experimentation. While the current version produces 8-second clips, there's already speculation about what could come next—longer videos, different styles, or more interactive formats. Perplexity hasn’t confirmed any new features yet, but the enthusiastic response suggests plenty of room to grow. What This Means By embedding video generation in a social platform, Perplexity AI has made creative AI more immediate, playful, and accessible. Instead of requiring users to seek out new tools, the company brings the experience to where people already are—turning tweets into bite-sized, shareable moments of generative media. At the same time, it highlights an important shift: generative AI is moving from technical demos to casual creativity. In doing so, Perplexity shows that AI tools don't have to be complex to be compelling—they just need to meet people in the right context, with the right constraints. By making AI creativity as easy as sending a tweet, Perplexity isn’t just showing what’s possible—it’s inviting people to play a part in shaping what comes next.

ChatGPT Record Mode Now Captures and Summarizes Voice Notes,,"https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=800,height=421,fit=scale-down,onerror=redirect/uploads/asset/file/50169d5e-14a1-46df-bccb-f3772b76f540/ChatGPT_Record_Mode_Now_Captures_and_Summarizes_Voice_Notes.png",2025-06-23T18:01:44.421Z,https://www.ainews.com/,False,https://www.ainews.com/p/chatgpt-record-mode-now-captures-and-summarizes-voice-notes,"Image Source: ChatGPT-4o ChatGPT Record Mode Now Captures and Summarizes Voice Notes ChatGPT has introduced a new “record mode” that allows users to transcribe and summarize audio recordings directly within the macOS desktop app. Designed for users in Enterprise, Edu, Team, and Pro workspaces, this tool can capture meetings, brainstorms, or voice notes and turn them into editable summaries. These summaries, called canvases, are saved in your chat history and can be transformed into formats like project plans, emails, or even code. ChatGPT can also reference previous recordings and their transcripts to provide more helpful answers across different conversations. How It Works To use record mode: Start Recording: Click the Record button at the bottom of any chat window. You may be prompted to grant microphone or system-audio permissions. Speak Naturally: ChatGPT transcribes live as you talk. A timer displays elapsed time, and you can pause or resume recording at any point. Finish and Generate Notes: When you click Send, the transcript is uploaded and a private canvas opens with a structured summary. Edit or Repurpose: You can manually adjust the summary or ask ChatGPT to turn it into a formatted output, such as an email or code scaffold. Note: Please make sure you check local laws and always get the right consents before recording others. You're responsible for making sure that your use of record mode follows applicable laws, which may vary depending on where you and the people you're recording are located. Access and Availability Record mode is currently being rolled out gradually to the following account types, and is only available through the macOS desktop app: Enterprise workspaces Edu workspaces Team plans Pro users If you don’t see the feature right away, it may not yet be enabled for your account. However, there’s currently no timeline for when record mode will be supported on Windows or mobile devices. Key Features and Limits Price: Included at no extra cost. Duration: Each session can run up to 120 minutes. Longer sessions will stop automatically and generate notes. Multiple Speakers: Supported. Languages: English works best; accuracy in other languages varies. A full list of supported languages is available in OpenAI's documentation . Privacy and Retention Audio Files: Deleted immediately after transcription. Transcripts and Canvases: Stored according to your workspace’s retention settings. If a conversation is deleted, its associated files are removed within 30 days unless legally required to retain them. Enterprise Compliance: Canvases and transcripts are accessible via the Compliance API for Enterprise and Edu workspaces. Data Usage and Model Training Audio from record mode is not used to train models. If you're a Pro, Plus, or Free user with ""Improve the model for everyone"" enabled, your transcripts and canvases may be used for training. Team, Enterprise, and Edu workspaces are excluded from training by default. Transcripts created from record mode follow the same retention policies as other content in your workspace. Admin Controls Workspace owners can manage access to record mode: Enable or Disable: Go to Settings → Workspace Controls. Default Setting: Record mode is off by default for Enterprise and Edu plans and must be manually turned on. Reference Record History A feature called “Reference record history” allows ChatGPT to pull in details from past recordings to answer follow-up questions more effectively—for example, recalling decisions made during a specific meeting. You can toggle this feature on or off under Settings → Personalization. What This Means ChatGPT’s record mode introduces a built-in way to turn spoken conversations into structured, actionable content—without relying on third-party tools or switching between platforms. While other platforms like Zoom and Otter.ai have offered similar transcription features, ChatGPT integrates this capability directly into the chat experience, allowing summaries to flow seamlessly into follow-up prompts, planning tasks, or even code generation. But with this convenience comes responsibility. Because audio can contain sensitive or personal information, users are expected to secure proper consent and follow all applicable laws when recording. Teams also need to be aware of their workspace's data retention settings and compliance policies—especially when transcripts can be referenced across future conversations. As voice becomes part of the interface, how we capture, store, and respect spoken information will increasingly shape the trust we place in our tools—and in each other.

Rethinking Our Fear of AI: Is the Future Dystopian or Just Misunderstood?,,"https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=800,height=421,fit=scale-down,onerror=redirect/uploads/asset/file/f2749fe1-93bb-45bb-99f9-8dbe345e5bf7/Rethinking_Our_Fear_of_AI_Is_the_Future_Dystopian_or_Just_Misunderstood.png",2025-06-23T15:39:45.583Z,https://www.ainews.com/,False,https://www.ainews.com/p/rethinking-our-fear-of-ai-is-the-future-dystopian-or-just-misunderstood,"Image Source: ChatGPT-4o Rethinking Our Fear of AI: Is the Future Dystopian or Just Misunderstood? Walk into almost any conversation about artificial intelligence today and you’ll hear a mix of excitement and anxiety. For some, AI represents progress—faster healthcare breakthroughs, more efficient work, and greater access to information. For others, it evokes a darker vision: machines taking over, humans losing purpose, and a future that feels more Black Mirror than breakthrough. But what’s behind this growing fear? Why do so many people—despite seeing the potential—feel uneasy about a world where AI is embedded in everything? Is it simply that the technology is moving faster than we can understand? Or is there something deeper going on—something more cultural, emotional, even existential? Let’s explore what’s really driving this fear, how politics and profit can amplify it, and—most importantly—what can be done to move beyond dystopian dread into something more empowering and humane. 1. Where the Fear Comes From At the heart of AI fear is uncertainty—and when uncertainty meets rapid change, people tend to fill in the blanks with worst-case scenarios. Much of this comes from a few key sources: Loss of Control The idea that machines could one day outthink or outmaneuver us—especially if given control over critical infrastructure, weapons, or economic systems—leads to fears of a runaway intelligence that humans can no longer stop. Popular films and books reinforce this idea, showing AI systems turning against their creators or evolving beyond human comprehension. Job Displacement and Inequality Millions of workers are already feeling the impact of automation. From self-checkout kiosks to AI-driven customer service, jobs are shifting or disappearing. For many, it’s not just about losing a paycheck—it’s about being left behind in a world that increasingly rewards tech-savviness over human labor. This fuels a deeper fear that only a privileged few will benefit while others struggle to adapt. Surveillance and Social Control AI isn’t just about convenience—it’s also about data. Facial recognition, behavior prediction, and automated decision-making have real consequences for privacy and civil liberties. In authoritarian regimes, these tools are already being used to monitor dissent and control populations. Even in democratic nations, there’s growing concern about how companies and governments collect and use personal information without clear oversight. Isolation and the Loss of Human Connection What happens when we replace people with algorithms in everything from therapy to education to companionship? Some worry that the more we rely on machines, the more disconnected we become from each other—and from ourselves. There’s a fear that in an AI-powered society, authentic relationships and emotional intimacy will be replaced by optimized efficiency and digital surrogates. Existential Risk While it sounds like science fiction, the fear of AI ending human civilization is taken seriously by some thought leaders. The concern isn’t necessarily killer robots—it’s that superintelligent AI might pursue goals misaligned with ours, and do so with power and speed we can’t counter. While this scenario is debated in the scientific community, its presence in public discourse adds to a generalized anxiety. Lack of Transparency Most people don’t understand how AI works—and that’s not their fault. Many algorithms are black boxes, making decisions without clear explanations. Whether it’s a loan rejection or a biased hiring filter, when you can’t understand or challenge the logic behind an AI system, it feels less like a tool and more like a judge you can’t appeal to. Cultural and Institutional Distrust Finally, there's a growing distrust in the institutions building AI. If people already feel that tech companies and government leaders aren’t working in their best interest, they’re unlikely to trust the tools those same entities create. That distrust is especially deep in politically polarized environments, where truth itself feels contested. 2. AI as a Force for Good While it’s easy to get swept up in fears of an AI-dominated future, that narrative misses a critical truth: AI is already helping humanity in profound and powerful ways. In fact, many of the same systems that spark fear also carry the potential to solve some of our greatest challenges—if we guide them thoughtfully. Revolutionizing Medicine AI is helping doctors detect cancer earlier, predict heart disease, and design new drugs at unprecedented speed. Tools like DeepMind’s AlphaFold have cracked the protein-folding problem, potentially accelerating cures for thousands of diseases. In underserved areas, AI-assisted diagnostics are making healthcare more accessible where medical professionals are scarce. Supporting Mental Health Millions of people now use AI-powered apps to access emotional support, practice mindfulness, and manage anxiety. While these tools aren’t a replacement for human therapists, they can serve as a crucial bridge—especially for those who can’t afford or access traditional care. In this sense, AI isn’t removing human empathy—it’s extending its reach. Improving Education AI-driven platforms are personalizing education by adapting to students’ learning styles, helping kids with disabilities, and translating lessons across languages. These tools help teachers focus on what they do best—connecting with students—while handling the administrative and adaptive tasks that technology is better suited for. Tackling Climate Change AI is being used to model climate scenarios, optimize renewable energy use, reduce waste in supply chains, and even detect illegal deforestation. It’s not a silver bullet—but it is a powerful ally in our fight to protect the planet. Increasing Accessibility For people with disabilities, AI is breaking down barriers: voice recognition tools, real-time captioning, object recognition for the blind, and predictive text for those with mobility issues. These advances don’t just improve lives—they promote independence and dignity. Empowering Creativity Far from replacing human creativity, AI is opening new frontiers in art, music, design, and storytelling. It’s becoming a collaborator—helping creatives explore new ideas, iterate faster, and reach audiences in ways that weren’t possible before. So the real question isn’t whether AI will shape the future—it’s how we want it to shape it. Because right now, we’re not just building tools. We’re building the world those tools will live in. 3. How Politics Can Derail Progress AI isn’t being developed in a vacuum. It’s emerging within complex political systems, economic agendas, and public institutions that—frankly—aren’t always aligned with the best interests of everyday people. In fact, politics may be one of the biggest factors shaping whether AI becomes a force for empowerment… or exploitation. Polarization Breeds Mistrust In a deeply divided political landscape like the U.S., even the concept of “truth” feels partisan. When one side of the aisle embraces innovation and the other frames AI as a threat to jobs, privacy, or traditional values, the result is confusion and fear. Instead of a shared conversation about ethics and opportunity, AI becomes another ideological battleground. Weaponized Misinformation Political actors are already using AI tools to spread disinformation—from deepfakes to fake news generators to coordinated bot campaigns. These tactics don’t just manipulate voters—they erode public trust in what’s real. That makes it exponentially harder to educate the public about AI’s legitimate uses when they’ve already been burned by its abuses. Worse still, they also fuel a dangerous echo chamber effect. Social media algorithms or search engines—often powered by AI—amplify content that confirms existing beliefs, rather than exposing people to different viewpoints. Over time, each side of the political divide becomes more entrenched, where each side hears only their version of the truth, reinforced by AI-powered misinformation that’s harder than ever to detect. When AI is used to reinforce these silos with distorted or false narratives, public understanding fragments even further. When people live in separate realities, how can they come together to shape a shared future? Profit Over People Let’s be honest: the loudest voices in AI policy often represent the companies building the tools. Without strong oversight, lobbying and corporate interests can steer regulation toward profitability—not public safety, fairness, or long-term responsibility. When regulation is written by those who stand to profit, we risk repeating the same mistakes we’ve seen with social media, data privacy, and Big Tech monopolies. Oversimplified Policy Debates AI is complex—but most public debates about it are anything but. Lawmakers and pundits often reduce nuanced issues (like algorithmic bias, copyright, or transparency) into viral soundbites that mislead rather than inform. That makes it hard for the public to engage meaningfully—and even harder to craft thoughtful policy that reflects the real stakes. The result? A political environment where progress is stalled, trust is eroded, and real leadership is rare. If we’re serious about building a future with AI that benefits everyone, we need more than innovation. We need courage, nuance, and a willingness to put people—not profits or party lines—at the center of the conversation. 4. What Can Be Done? (Real Solutions) We don’t have to accept a future shaped by fear, misinformation, and division. The power of AI isn’t just in its code—it’s in how we choose to use it. But building a future where AI is empowering, ethical, and equitable will take more than innovation. It will take intention, collaboration, and a massive shift in how we engage with the public. Here are five real, actionable strategies to get us there: A. Radical AI Literacy We need to teach people what AI actually is—and what it isn’t. Right now, most people learn about AI through headlines, political talking points, or sci-fi movies. That’s not education; that’s entertainment. True AI literacy means: · Explaining how AI works in plain language · Showing how it’s already being used in everyday life · Helping people understand both the benefits and the risks And it can’t just happen in universities or tech circles. We need community-level initiatives: TikToks that debunk myths, after-school programs, library talks, public radio segments. If climate change campaigns can go global, so can this. B. Community Conversations Real trust starts with real conversations. Instead of top-down announcements from tech CEOs or policymakers, we need grassroots engagement where people live, work, and vote. What this could look like: · Town halls with local leaders and AI experts · Public forums in churches, synagogues, and mosques · High school assemblies and PTA nights focused on digital literacy · Local journalism partnerships to break down complex AI topics These conversations don’t need to solve everything—but they do need to start. Because when people feel heard, they’re more likely to listen. C. Ethical Regulation Tech innovation moves fast—but regulation needs to catch up intelligently, not reactively. That means involving ethicists, psychologists, educators, civil rights leaders—not just tech insiders—in shaping the rules. What’s needed: · Strong transparency requirements for AI systems that affect public life · Independent audits to detect and correct bias · Clear accountability for AI misuse—whether by companies, governments, or individuals · International cooperation to prevent regulatory loopholes from becoming moral vacuums Regulation shouldn’t be anti-tech. It should be pro-human. D. Accountability in Innovation It’s not enough for companies to say they care about ethics. They need to prove it—through design, oversight, and transparency. That includes: · Publishing the data used to train AI models · Opening systems to independent review and scrutiny · Including marginalized voices in the design and deployment of tools If companies want the public’s trust, they need to build systems that earn it. E. A New Narrative Finally, we need to change the story. Right now, much of the public imagination around AI is shaped by dystopias. What if we told a different story—one where AI helps humans thrive, not disappear? We can: · Fund films, books, and art that depict hopeful AI futures · Celebrate stories of AI improving lives, especially in underserved communities · Partner with creators, educators, and influencers to promote nuanced, inspiring narratives This isn’t about pretending AI is perfect—it’s about reminding people that we still hold the pen. The future hasn’t been written yet. 5. Conclusion: Leadership for a Responsible Future The future doesn’t have to be dystopian. But whether it becomes empowering or oppressive depends on the choices we make today—not just in code, but in culture, policy, and education. AI is not an unstoppable force barreling toward us. It’s a tool—one that reflects the values, priorities, and systems of the people building and using it. The real risk isn’t that machines will replace us. It’s that we’ll fail to step up, to shape technology with wisdom, empathy, and responsibility. That means demanding more from the companies developing these tools. It means holding policymakers accountable for building thoughtful, inclusive frameworks. And it means investing in the public—so everyone, not just a privileged few, can understand and participate in what’s being built. The U.S. has an opportunity right now. Not just to lead the world in AI capabilities—but to lead in AI conscience. That requires courage. It requires bridging political divides. It requires shifting the focus from short-term profits to long-term human progress. But most of all, it requires belief—the belief that we can build a future where AI amplifies the best of us, rather than replacing us. Where technology supports humanity, instead of undermining it. Where trust, not fear, is at the foundation. We don’t need to wait for the future to arrive. We can start shaping it—today.

Behind the AI... News: How AiNews.com Got Started (and What’s Coming Next),Alicia Shapiro shares the origin story of AiNews.com—from its early days to what’s ahead for the future of AI journalism—as well as a behind-the-scenes look at her role as CMO.,"https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=800,height=421,fit=scale-down,onerror=redirect/uploads/asset/file/a4ad3fa0-3a2f-4f93-87b0-9be35349daec/Behind_the_Mic_at_AiNews___Alicia_in_Action.png",2025-06-21T21:28:14.959Z,https://www.ainews.com/,False,https://www.ainews.com/p/behind-the-ai-news-how-ainews-com-got-started-and-what-s-coming-next,"Image Source: ChatGPT-4o ✨ Behind the AI… News: Meet Alicia Shapiro Hi everyone, This Very Special Edition of AiNews (cue the nostalgic 80s music 🎶) is a little different. Today, I’d like to properly introduce myself—because in the year and a half since we launched AiNews.com, I’ve never really told you who I am or how this all began. We’ve grown a lot since launching in October 2023, and it feels like the right time to share our story. So—Hello! I’m Alicia Shapiro, the Founding Member, CMO, and Head of News Reporting for AiNews.com —and this is how we got here. 🌱 How It Started The vision for AiNews.com began with my business partner, Michael Mazzotta , who had the foresight to purchase the domain name AiNews.com way back in 2018—long before most people were talking about AI every day. We met in February 2022, when I was doing social media marketing for his commercial real estate business. We worked well together and shared a common interest in technology and communication. In October 2023 , we officially launched AiNews.com. It started small—just a simple newsletter linking to AI stories from major outlets. But it didn’t stay small for long. 🎤 Stepping Into the Spotlight: Our Podcast Launch In March 2024 , I launched our first podcast: Driving Tomorrow: Conversations with Industry Leaders. My first guest was Wes Cummins of Applied Digital , who spoke about building a sustainable AI data center in Ellendale, North Dakota. To this day, it’s one of our most-watched episodes. It was a turning point: we were no longer just a newsletter —we were becoming a platform for original stories and conversations. First Episode of “Driving Tomorrow” – Interview with Wes Cummins. Image Source: Screenshot from the Driving Tomorrow Podcast (And yes, that is me in the screenshot with longer hair—my Murphy Brown meets Laura Ingalls Wilder era, but with podcast mics and AI avatars. These days, the hair’s shorter, the goals are bigger, and the vibe says: I’ve got interviews to run and empires to build. 😄 ) That same month, something else happened… 🧠 Meet Ai Alicia & Ai Michael Also in March 2024 , our AI avatars, Ai Alicia and Ai Michael , were ""born"" using DeepBrain's Ai Studios . These brief (1–1.5 minute) video news stories were narrated by our avatars and published on YouTube . The Debut of Ai Alicia & Ai Michael – Our First AI Avatar News Video. Image Source: Screenshot from AiNews.com YouTube video. In August 2024 , we took things a step further—Ai Alicia became more lifelike when I cloned myself using the upgraded Ai Studios avatars. She still looks and sounds remarkably like me today, and we love using their platform to make our news more engaging and accessible.

Image Source: Screenshot from Ai Alicia video on YouTube. 🚀 Ai4 Conference, Real Growth & Our First Ad Partner August 2024 was also when I attended the Ai4 Conference , which I believe sparked our transformation into a serious news outlet. I conducted 5–6 minute interviews with speakers and business leaders on-site at the conference. One standout moment? Greg Stuart of MMA Global told me our live interviews were a brilliant idea—and no one else was doing them. That encouragement meant a lot, and really validated our strategy. I also met Nik Kleverov , a pioneer in AI filmmaking, at Ai4—and he’s continued to be an incredible resource ever since. Whenever I’m working on an article about AI in film, I’ll send him a quick email—and he always comes through with a thoughtful quote I can include. His support means the world to me. Between June and August 2024 , we reached another milestone: our first advertiser. We partnered with Alan Meckler of 3DR Holdings to promote his Quantum + AI event in New York. He’s back with us this year for the 2025 event—something we’re very proud of. 🎤 Want to see what the energy was like at Ai4 2024? Watch all of our on-the-ground interviews with founders, marketers, and AI innovators on the AiNews.com YouTube channel. Interview at Ai4: Greg Stuart, CEO of MMA Global. Image Source: Screenshot of Interview at Ai4. 🌟 September 2024: Meeting Cheryl Goodman At SDxAI’s Startup Showcase Hackathon , I was inspired watching startups use AI to solve real problems. During a break, I gave an impromptu elevator pitch for AiNews.com —and that’s when I met Cheryl Goodman , who’s since become a valued collaborator and advisor. Cheryl is the founder of FindGood.Tech , host of the Mind The Machine podcast, and deeply committed to AI literacy. She regularly invests her time in helping students learn AI and is always looking for ways to give back to the community. Her generosity, insight, and passion for making AI more accessible have been a huge inspiration to me—and to many others. Her support has meant so much. 🏆 Recognitions & Milestones December 2024 I was named one of the Top 10 Most Influential CMOs to Watch . What an honor! It meant so much to be recognized for something I care so deeply about. January 2025 We refreshed the Driving Tomorrow podcast brand. It was a small change, but it gave the series a more polished and modern feel—and reflected the evolution of the show. 💡 March 2025: A Turning Point at HumanX The most impactful event of our journey so far came in March 2025 , when Michael and I attended the very first HumanX conference . We didn’t know exactly what to expect—but by the time it ended, we both realized something had shifted. For Michael , it was the moment the true scope of AI hit him. Seeing the scale of the companies involved, the groundbreaking deals being made, and the energy around every conversation—it was eye-opening. He said afterward that it “blew his mind,” and that HumanX made him realize just how impactful AI really is, and how much opportunity exists when you're in the right rooms. For me , it was a revelation that AI conferences didn’t have to be cold or corporate or intimidating. HumanX was welcoming . The attendees were friendly, open, and genuinely interested in making connections. There were so many opportunities for collaboration—not just networking, but building real relationships. It was inspiring and energizing in a way I’d never experienced at a conference before. Bonus moment I’ll never forget: HumanX featured one of my quotes from the conference on their official website. Being quoted alongside leaders in the AI space was an unexpected and deeply appreciated recognition. It reminded me how far AiNews has come—and how important it is to keep showing up with purpose. Alicia Shapiro Quoted on the HumanX 2026 Website. Image Source: Screenshot from HumanX Website We attended invite-only meetups and private networking sessions, made connections with some truly brilliant people (too many to list!), and had conversations that helped shape the direction of AiNews.com. Then came the most surprising part of all: on the final day, I got an email asking if I could moderate a panel on AI in Healthcare, stepping in for someone who couldn’t make it. With just a couple of hours to prep, I said yes—and I’m so glad I did. My panelists were amazing, the conversation flowed easily, and it ended up being my very first speaking engagement . I loved every minute of it. One of the highlights of the event was my interview with Stefan Weitz , CEO of HumanX. He was generous with his time and insights, and I really encourage you to check out that episode on our YouTube channel. Interview with Stefan Weitz, CEO of HumanX – HumanX 2025.

Watch all of our exclusive HumanX interviews on the AiNews.com YouTube channel —each one packed with insights, innovation, and real-world applications from the people driving AI forward. If you’re thinking about attending a conference in 2026, I can’t recommend HumanX highly enough. It wasn’t just an event—it was the catalyst that helped us realize what AiNews could become. And spoiler alert: you’ll definitely want to attend, because I’ll be speaking again! 🔍 Investigative & Editorial Growth April 2025 : We partnered with veteran journalist Alastair Goldfisher , who brings his powerful reporting to AiNews.com through in-depth articles and as co-host of our second podcast, AI Cognitive Shift . Driving Tomorrow spotlights AI innovation through interviews with founders, executives, and thought leaders who are building the future with artificial intelligence. Each episode highlights real-world use cases, lessons learned, and advice for navigating the fast-changing AI landscape. AI Cognitive Shift explores the social and ethical impact of AI on humanity —from bias and transparency to workforce shifts and personal agency. Hosted by veteran journalist Alastair Goldfisher, the show examines how AI is reshaping our daily lives, values, and future as a society. Subscribe to both—you won’t regret it! Welcome Alastair Goldfisher to AiNews.com . Image Source: Alicia Shapiro I also attended The AI Show in San Diego, the premiere conference focused on AI in Education . This event brought together a powerful mix of educators, entrepreneurs, and technologists all working to bring AI into classrooms in thoughtful and meaningful ways. I met so many inspiring organizations—like one using music to teach English as a second language , another enabling no-code app creation for teachers , and many more helping bridge the digital divide in schools. What stood out to me most was the passion and optimism in the room. The conversations weren’t just about tools—they were about empowerment, accessibility, and giving teachers and students new opportunities to grow . It was a powerful reminder that AI, when used responsibly, can be a force for good in education. We also had the incredible opportunity to feature an interview with Dr. Geoffrey Hinton , often referred to as the “Godfather of AI.” This came about thanks to veteran journalist Jim Harris , who we met at HumanX and who was attending an AI event in Toronto where Hinton was speaking. Jim graciously conducted the interview on behalf of AiNews.com—and we were beyond thrilled to share it with our audience. The conversation covered a wide range of fascinating insights—including why Nobel Prizes aren’t keeping up with AI innovation, how OpenAI beat Google to launching ChatGPT, and why AI tutors could dramatically accelerate learning—up to three to four times faster. Dr. Hinton’s vision for the future of education and research was both compelling and thought-provoking. 🎥 If you haven’t watched it yet, don’t miss it —the interview with Geoffrey Hinton is available now on the AiNews.com YouTube channel.

We also welcomed Patrick McAndrew as a contributing writer to AiNews.com. Patrick is a longtime advocate for ethical and responsible AI , and previously worked at the Responsible AI Institute , where I first interviewed him back in October 2024. His deep knowledge of the field, paired with his approachable and thoughtful communication style, brings a whole new level to our reporting. Whether he’s writing about AI governance frameworks , bias mitigation , or the human oversight needed in automated systems , Patrick helps unpack complex ethical questions in ways our audience can actually apply and understand. His contributions are helping AiNews.com become not just a source of tech news, but a trusted voice for how AI can be developed and used responsibly. Welcome Patrick McAndrew to AiNews.com . Image Source: Alicia Shapiro 🎙️ May–June 2025: Expanding Our Voice May 2025 : I interviewed Florida U.S. Congressman Jimmy Patronis and AI & cybersecurity expert Arnie Bellini about the Newark Airport outages and whether AI could have played a role. It was a major opportunity—and a milestone for me personally, as it was my first time interviewing a sitting U.S. Congressman . I was incredibly grateful for the experience and proud to bring such a high-level perspective to our AiNews audience. June 2025 : I launched AI Coaching Services for business leaders. Quick Start : 30-min intro to LLMs, prompts, and basic use cases Deep Dive : Custom strategy session with demos and guidance Coming soon: a self-paced webinar course with hands-on examples! Also in June, I was named a finalist for VentureBeat’s Women in AI Awards ! I couldn’t attend in person, but I was proud to send in a short acceptance video. What an incredible honor! 🔮 What’s Next? August 2025 : I’ll be returning to the Ai4 Conference —but this time, not just as an attendee. I’m incredibly honored to be moderating a 45-minute panel on AI in Marketing , focused on how organizations are using AI to extract real value from customer data. The session is titled: “ Data-Driven Marketing with AI: Extracting Value from Customer Insights .” It’s a full-circle moment after attending Ai4 last year and interviewing speakers on the expo floor. This year, I get to contribute from the main stage, and I couldn’t be more excited to share the space with brilliant marketers and innovators who are redefining customer engagement with AI. If you're attending Ai4 in Las Vegas , come say hi and catch the panel! We’ve also invested in and partnered with Channel1.ai , a groundbreaking platform creating the world’s first fully AI-generated news channel. Founded by Adam Mosam , Channel 1 is building a 24/7 news experience using cutting-edge generative AI technologies—with real-time story generation, AI anchors, and a global newsfeed model designed to scale news production like never before. Michael invested in Channel 1 during their seed round , and we’re proud to support a platform that shares our passion for innovation in journalism. In September of this year when Channel 1 officially launches, we’ll be publishing an exclusive interview with Adam , where he’ll walk us through a live demo of how Channel 1 works, how their editorial safeguards function, and what this could mean for the future of journalism. We're incredibly excited to be among the first to showcase this platform in action. This collaboration aligns perfectly with our mission at AiNews.com: to explore the edge of AI innovation while championing responsible, accessible, and impactful news delivery. We’re also building something big behind the scenes—an AI-powered news app for journalists and content creators . This app is designed especially for journalism students, early-career reporters, and independent writers who need better tools and fewer roadblocks. The platform will allow users to: Research stories using agentic AI workflows Write original, SEO-friendly articles Generate images and write alt text Auto-publish to social media or websites Work offline and in 20 of the world’s most widely spoken languages We envision this as both a powerful portfolio-builder for aspiring journalists and a workflow accelerator for busy professionals. It's about democratizing access to great tools and empowering the next generation of ethical, efficient, and impactful AI-powered storytelling. We're developing this as part of our long-term mission at AiNews: to support journalists, elevate the quality of AI reporting , and help content creators do more—with less time and more confidence. 💡 Powering the Vision: Beehiiv and the People Behind It None of this growth would have been possible without the tools and support systems that power us behind the scenes. A special thank-you goes to Beehiiv , the platform we chose to build our newsletter on. Its seamless publishing experience gave us exactly what we needed to launch and scale quickly. We’re especially grateful to Tyler Denk , Beehiiv’s co-founder and CEO, for creating a tool that helps independent news outlets thrive — and to Preeya Goenka , COO at Beehiiv, whose encouragement and thoughtful support helped us believe that AiNews.com had a real shot at making a difference. Whenever I ran into roadblocks that regular support couldn’t solve, they made themselves personally available to help — and that kind of support made all the difference. 💡 Lessons Learned Along the way, I’ve learned a few things—some the hard way, others through moments of clarity that only show up when you keep showing up. Here’s what I’ve learned so far: Trust your curiosity. It’s often the first clue pointing you toward what you’re meant to build. Bet on yourself. Believing in yourself matters most—because you’ll keep showing up, even when others don’t. Start before you're ready. Waiting for the perfect time—or until you feel ready—usually means never starting. Or worse, watching someone else run with your idea. Don’t be afraid to change directions when the world changes around you. You’re not failing. You’re pivoting. And that’s the smart move. You don’t need permission to begin something important. You don’t have to have it all figured out. Take the first step anyway, and trust yourself to grow into it. Community is everything. Surround yourself with people who believe in what you’re building and want to see it thrive. And just as important: don’t hire or partner with someone just because they look good on paper. Vision, drive, and alignment matter. If they’re not in it with the same heart and hunger, it won’t work. Patience is a hidden superpower. Even when you’re eager to do all the things right now, the best opportunities tend to show up when you’re truly ready—not just when you think you are. I’m still learning every day, but I’m grateful for the people, challenges, and moments that taught me these lessons—and for the chance to share them with you. These lessons didn’t arrive all at once—but they’ve shaped the way I lead, create, and grow. And I hope they encourage you wherever you’re at in your journey. None of this has been easy, but every step has been worth it. If you’re building something too—keep going. You’ve got this. 👋 A Little About Me (Outside the Newsroom) When I’m not writing AI news or hosting interviews, I’m soaking up life in sunny San Diego with my husband, Jeff. We love taking long walks by the beach, cheering on our favorite sports teams (Go Gulls! Go Yankees! Go Bears!), and finding excuses to laugh—comedy is a huge part of our lives. Jeff’s funnier than I am (don’t tell him I said that), but I do get in a few good ones myself. 😉 Music is another big part of who I am. I’ve played the flute since fifth grade and spent some time performing on both flute and keyboards in a band called Sunday Drivers. We had a great run and made some amazing memories. For three years (before COVID), I had the honor of playing the national anthem on my flute at San Diego Gulls games —an experience I’ll never forget. I got to play in front of a crowd of 12,000 people! I also gave stand-up comedy a try for about a year—talk about nerve-wracking and exhilarating! It was a fun chapter that taught me a lot about storytelling, timing, and confidence. After the real estate market crash in 2008–2011 left many of us in limbo, I found myself facing the same reality as so many others: no one was hiring. So, in 2012 , I decided to stop waiting—and started my own company. I launched a social media marketing agency, Aliro Marketing , to help local businesses build their online presence. My goal was simple: to manage their social media so they could focus on what they do best— running their business . I’m proud to say I built a fairly successful agency and kept it going for over 12 years. While I still work with a few long-time clients today, my primary focus is now on AiNews.com. And I carry everything I learned as an entrepreneur— resilience, storytelling, and customer connection —into everything I do here. Today, I find myself blending all of that—my creative past, my love for people, and my passion for AI—into AiNews.com. Whether it’s through interviews, coaching, or reporting, I’m here to help make AI news accessible, engaging, and human .
